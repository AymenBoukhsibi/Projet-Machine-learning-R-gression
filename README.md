# Machine Learning Project – Regression Case

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a **Machine Learning application focused on regression analysis**. The objective is to model and predict a continuous target variable based on one or more explanatory features, using statistical and machine learning regression techniques.

The complete implementation and analysis are available in the Jupyter Notebook:
`Projet Machine Learning cas de Régression.ipynb`.

## 🧾 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains:

* **Input features (X)**: numerical and/or categorical variables relevant to the prediction task
* **Target variable (y)**: a continuous value to be predicted

Data preparation steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling when necessary.

## ⚙️ Methods & Techniques

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Feature selection and normalization
* Regression models, such as:

  * Linear Regression
  * Multiple Linear Regression
  * (Optional) Ridge / Lasso Regression
* Model training and validation

## 📊 Model Evaluation

The regression models are evaluated using metrics such as:

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* R² Score

Visualizations (prediction vs actual values, error plots) are included in the notebook.
